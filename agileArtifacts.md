# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required) 
- ~~Implement a privacy handling policy~~
- ~~Implement a strict content security policy~~
- Create and implement CSS for all pages, including ~~sign-up, login~~, log/diary
- ~~SQLite database design and integration~~
- ~~Ability for new team members to self-sign up aswell as existing members to login~~ 
- ~~Document and implement an appropriate hashing algorithm for securely storing passwords in the database.~~  
- Input sanitisation for ~~login/sign-up~~ and log entries

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)

- Have a privacy handling policy that can be easily accessed by users in the app
- Have a strict content security policy that reduces the risk and impact of XXS attacks 
- Create pages for sign up and sign in that are user friendly and help the functionality of the app 
- Have a effective hashing algorithm to store passwords
- Have input sanitisation for both log in and sign up forms 

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)
### What challenges did you have
 - Implementing CSS for login and sign-up pages. I found it difficult to make the pages both visually appealing and practical. I experimented with different looks utilising bootstrap frameworks. 
 - Getting the CSRF tokens to work. I was unfamiliar with how these tokens worked so it took me time to properly implement them. 
 - I wasn't used to the agile approach being used. Sometimes I find myself sidetracking and not specifically focusing on the list of acheivable set in the agile backlog. 
### What did you do well
- Implementing an effective hashing method to store passwords. This was made easier by utilsing flask's in-built library 'werkzeug'.
- Implementing the login and sign-up logic. Using previous work as reference, I found this to be relatively simple and done effectively.  
### What will you do differently next time
- Have a better idea of how I want my pages to be set out. Maybe using a storyboard to better plan it out for next time.
- Stick more closer to an agile approach, making sure I'm on track to deliver my achievables set within the sprint.
